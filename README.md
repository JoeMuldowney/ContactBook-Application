#Description
This project is a school assignment that aims to create a versatile contact book application. It allows users to manage contact information efficiently, offering features like adding, updating, and deleting contacts and their associated details.

#Usage

You can start by adding contacts and their contact information. The application provides an intuitive interface for inputting contact names, phone numbers, and email addresses.

Once you've added your contacts and their details, the application automatically saves them as a .txt file. This ensures that your contact information is readily available whenever you use the app.

Beyond basic contact management, this application offers several advanced features:
Search Contacts to quickly find the contacts you need using search functionality.
Create New Contacts and Contact Info.
Delete Contacts and Contact Info to easily remove outdated or unnecessary contacts and their associated details.
